<h3>Sweeney Todd</h3>
<p>This is my favorite musical. I love the dramatic music and images.</p>
<h3>Amelie</h3>
<p>This movie is entirely in French. I love the quarky characters, the music by Yann Tiersen, and the joy it brings to me each time I watch it.</p>
<h3>The Holiday</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Rom-Com. The actors do a phenomenal job and I get pulled into the love stories everytime.</p>
